This option suppresses warnings about missing semicolons. There is a lot
of FUD about semicolon spread by quite a few people in the community.
The common myths are that semicolons are required all the time (they are
not) and that they are unreliable. JavaScript has rules about semicolons
which are followed by *all* browsers so it is up to you to decide
whether you should or should not use semicolons in your code.
For more information about semicolons in JavaScript read [An Open Letter
to JavaScript Leaders Regarding
Semicolons](http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding)
