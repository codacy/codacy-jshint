# quotmark

This option enforces the consistency of quotation marks used throughout
your code. It accepts three values: `true` if you don't want to enforce
one particular style but want some consistency, `"single"` if you want to
allow only single quotes and `"double"` if you want to allow only double
quotes.
@deprecated JSHint is limiting its scope to issues of code correctness. If
            you would like to enforce rules relating to code style, check
            out [the JSCS project](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs).
