# noempty

This option warns when you have an empty block in your code. JSLint was
originally warning for all empty blocks and we simply made it optional.
There were no studies reporting that empty blocks in JavaScript break
your code in any way.
@deprecated JSHint is limiting its scope to issues of code correctness.
            If you would like to enforce rules relating to code style,
            check out [the JSCS
            project](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs).
